# AI Consistent Character Generation Pipeline

This project aims to generate consistent character expressions for 2D illustrations using AI-powered image generation techniques. It leverages the Hugging Face Inference API with the Stable Diffusion XL model to create high-quality, diverse expressions while maintaining character consistency.

## Project Overview

The AI Consistent Character Generation Pipeline takes a 2D character illustration as input and generates six different expressions: smiling, laughing, surprised, sad, mad, and afraid. The project uses the Stable Diffusion XL model via the Hugging Face Inference API to create high-quality, AI-powered expressions.

The project is generating custom expression images for now, when integration with ComfyUI completed, we will achieve our goal for "Consistent Character Generation Pipeline"

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/emirbartu/sd-expression.git
   cd sd-expression
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pillow requests numpy scikit-learn
   ```

3. Set up your Hugging Face API token as an environment variable:
   ```
   export HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
   ```

## Usage

To use the Hugging Face API script:

1. Ensure you have set up your Hugging Face API token as an environment variable.
2. Prepare a 2D character illustration in PNG format.
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python comfyui_api_script.py path/to/your/input_image.png
   ```
4. The script will generate six images with different expressions in the current directory.

Optional: You can specify the maximum number of retries for API calls:
```
python comfyui_api_script.py path/to/your/input_image.png --max_retries 5
```

## Generated Expressions

The project includes a "generated_expressions" folder in the main branch of the repository. This folder is used to store the images generated by the script. Each time you run the script, it will create six new images (one for each expression) and save them in this folder. This allows you to easily access and manage the generated expressions for your characters.

# ComfyUI Integration
   ## Will be updated...


## Configuration

The script uses a configuration dictionary (`CONFIG`) to set various parameters for the image generation process. You can modify these settings in the `comfyui_api_script.py` file:

- `HF_MODEL`: The Hugging Face model to use (default: "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0")
- `STEPS`: Number of inference steps (default: 30)
- `GUIDANCE_SCALE`: Guidance scale for generation (default: 7.5)
- `STRENGTH`: Strength of the transformation (default: 0.7)
- `SAMPLER`: Sampling method (default: "lcm")
- `SCHEDULER`: Scheduler type (default: "normal")

## Background Removal

The script includes a basic background removal function using K-means clustering. This helps isolate the character from the background in the generated images. The background removal process is automatically applied to each generated expression.

## Future Development

- Improve the background removal algorithm for better accuracy.
- Enhance ComfyUI integration with more customizable options.
- Implement fine-tuning options for better consistency across generated expressions.
- Add support for custom prompts and more diverse expression types.
